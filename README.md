# Command-Line Application

## A functional Command-Line Application written in Rust!

This application executes basic CLI commands including cat (for displaying file contents), clear (for clearing the terminal screen), echo (for displaying a line of text), help ( for displaying command descriptions), ls (for listing directory contents), mkdir (for creating directories) and pwd (for displaying the current path directory).

* The entire part was built with Rust. Every command has a separate library, and every command library links with one library called libs.rs. This lib.rs is executed in the main function main.rs.
